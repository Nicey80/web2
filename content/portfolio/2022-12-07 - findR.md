**Whether its Chinese in Canterbury or Indian in Iwade - findR has them all**

Powered by Yelp Search I've developed a quick app to allow people to quickly find businesses or places of interest in the UK of their choosing and allowing a filter by rating.  

## App Details

Hosted on my own Shiny Server instance with thanks to the excellent instructions from charlesbordet (https://www.charlesbordet.com/en/guide-shiny-aws/) the app uses the functions within the yelpr (https://github.com/OmaymaS/yelpr) package to integrate a simple search function and leaflet mapping display.
