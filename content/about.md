I'm Paul Nice when I'm not playing cricket or being a Dance Dad to my 2 amazing daughters I love nothing else that digging into some data to find some interesting nuggets and paint some beautiful dataviz stories. I currently work in the UK telecoms sector using data to answer the questions of what will tomorrow bring and how can we plan for it better. I spend lots of time working with timeseries data, automating data collection routines and crunching data from multiple different data sources. I'm an R enthusiast particularly the tidyverse and shiny to build beautiful pipelines and dashboards but also enjoy the more traditional Excel, VBA & PowerBI.

I love data/stats heavy sports so if I can find a way to cross my love of data with my love of sports then all the better. I plan to devote some blog posts to looking at NFL data
